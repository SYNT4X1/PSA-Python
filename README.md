    Hello world, how are you today? PSA, Polymorphic Subsitution Algorithm, is a python based encryption method made with the sole purpose of "polmorphising"
    the obfuscated data all whilst retaining identification through decryption. There has been a real time application of the encryption method using python
    sockets and a raspi, although for more general use cases, I would recommend down scaling the encryption method. Wait, Down scaling? Yes! PSA, is %100
    scalable in every sense of the word. So if you want more variance in the polymorphic obfuscation, simply add it, all with the assumption you have the
    resources to do so. One of the immediate drawbacks of PSA, is it's abundment amount of memory usage and data output, so if you plan to use it for any
    legitmate purposes, keep that in mind.
